Fraud Detection :

Steps to run the project: 

1) run model.py to see the number of fraudulent transactions and the accuracy of fraud detection by the model.
2) To do a real time fraud detection, run app.py and then give it curl transaction requests to check if the transaction is fraudulent or not.(Sample curl requests are available in the Live Fraud Detection.txt)
